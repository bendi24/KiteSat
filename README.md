# KiteSat
Hello, we are the KiteSat team. A group of five and we are particapuing the cansat competition of ESA. Our firs mission is to get down the cansat safely from 2 km in the air and while flying, meassure air temperature and air preassure. We need to send the meassurements to the ground station with a minimum of 1 send per second.

As the secondary mission goes, we will be measuring the UV radiaton in relation to the altitude.
